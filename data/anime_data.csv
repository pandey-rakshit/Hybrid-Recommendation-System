The February 2004 issue of the Cinefantastique American magazine listed it as one of the 10 Essential Anime. It ranked second in the 100 Select Works of Media Arts survey for the animation category, which was held in 2006 by the Japan Media Arts Festival. The series also won several awards: the Special Award at the second Television Reporters Conference in 1964, The Ministry of Health and Welfare Award in 1965, and the Galaxy Award at the fourth Broadcast Critics' Discussion in 1967. When television producer Fred Ladd helped NBC Enterprises adapt the series for broadcast in the United States in 1963, the title Astro Boy was used instead of the manga's English title Mighty Atom. Only the first 104 episodes were made available in English and aired in an alternative order, with adjustments for the American audience. In North America, Right Stuf International released several VHS tapes of the series between 1989 and 1995; the company returned with all 104 episodes on DVD—as a collection of two 11-disc sets—from March 27, 2006, to August 29, 2006.

The movie features iconic characters of Tezuka's various works, with certain designs such as the Phoenix's having at least three renditions. The methods employed for special effects in the movie include scan camera shots, CGI, live-action filming, ""2-frame photography,"" 3D manipulation, rotoscoping, and more. Re-titled Space Firebird, the anime was one of the most widely distributed of the videos that have found their way into the Bargain Bin. The English version was first seen on US television in 1982, but was cut down by 20 minutes. A few months later, it was released in the UK on VHS & Betamax by Mountain Video in the same format and widely publicized. However, the video disappeared from store shelves two years later and was never re-released by another distributor. In the US, it was issued as VHS only in 1987 from the popular Celebrity Just For Kids. While the dub was the same, the movie was 10 minutes shorter, omitting some sundry scenes and the end credits. In 1980, Hi no Tori 2772: Ai no CosmoZone won the Inkpot Award at the San Diego Comic Convention and the Animation Award at the first Las Vegas Film Festival. It was also nominated at the Saturn Awards for the best animated movie category in 1983.",,,TOHO,,Tezuka Productions,"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy, Romance, Sci-Fi",,Space,

The movie's final budget was $137 million dollar budget, due to the high costs of the technology being used for the film's computer animation. With marketing costs included, The Spirits Within lost in excess of $94 million. Adjusted for 2016 inflation, this amounts to over $126 million. Not only did this directly lead to the closing of Square Pictures, but it also delayed the parent company Square from completing its planned merger with the video game publishing company Enix.

He does, however, appear in flashbacks to the Golden Mask conclusion. This is also the second time voice actor Ichirou Nagai appears in a Kinnikuman work playing the main villain. He had previously appeared in the TV Special. It also features the return of voice actors Kouzou Shioya and Yasuo Tanaka, who had previously appeared in the first film Stolen Championship Belt.

Some changes were made such as Lupin was no longer a thief but a detective, Jigen was no longer a smoker and it was set in the future. It was decided that the series was going to be called Arsène et Cie in France while it was called Lupin VIII internationally. Rintaro (Shigeyuki Hayashi) who worked on Captain Harlock and Galaxy Express 999 was the director and Shingo Araki was brought in as a character designer along with Michi Himeno. Monkey Punch had originally came up with character designs of the cast however the character designs had changed from his early designs. There was a problem during production and that was with the Maurice Leblanc estate. While the Lupin name was used in Japan and Italy at this point without issues, the Maurice Leblanc estate demanded money for the use of the Lupin name while TMS and DiC refused to pay what they were asking. This was also the same issue that had problems releasing the series outside of Japan with France adopting the Edgar de la Cambriole name, Lupin was renamed to Wolf or Cliff in the US while Spain and Italy that kept the Lupin name had to distance from Arsène Lupin affecting later dubbed episodes of Lupin the 3rd Part 2.

2981,Chika Gentou Gekiga: Shoujo Tsubaki,Midori,地下幻燈劇画 少女椿,Movie,Manga,1.0,Finished Airing,False,"May 2, 1992",47 min,R+ - Mild Nudity,4.73,36271.0,13497.0,2757,70472,432,"The ""Shoujo Tsubaki"" or ""Camellia Girl"" character was a common stock protagonist regularly featured in Japanese street theater throughout the 1920s. The character typically manifested as a young and impoverished female adolescent who sold camellia flowers on the streets. One incarnation of the character features in a short story, also titled ""Shouji Tsubaki,"" within an anthology—eventually repurposed as a full-length graphic novel by Suehiro Maruo, known as Mr. Arashi’s Amazing Freak Show in English. This, in turn, was adapted into the animated film Chika Gentou Gekiga: Shoujo Tsubaki, which roughly translates to ""Underground Projected Dramatic Pictures: The Camellia Girl."" The film is known simply as Midori in releases outside of Japan. Aside from the music, sound effects, and an uncredited voice cast, the entirety of the film was created almost exclusively by Hiroshi Harada under the pseudonym ""Hisaaki Etsu,"" who handled directing, scripting, drawing, and animating. Composer J. A. Seazer assisted with the soundtrack. Production began in 1987, the film took five years to produce, and it consists of over five thousand hand-drawn sheets of animation. Due to the film’s graphic imagery, the production received no sponsors and was instead funded using Harada’s life savings and retirement fund. The early marketing for the film was deliberately cryptic, and Harada intended for it to only be viewed at specially held screenings. The film premiered in May 1992 under a large red tent at the Mitake Jinja Shinto Shrine in Tokyo. It was accompanied by realtime special effects, including confetti and smoke bombs. Underground theater group Aka Neko Za performed stunts from the film and interacted with the audience throughout its duration. These performances would complement the film in succeeding years, before its ban. Chika Gentou Gekiga: Shoujo Tsubaki was screened unedited until 1994, when Japanese film censor board Eirin made 26 cuts and alterations. From 1994 to 2006, the film could only be viewed in its heavily censored state at film festival screenings and theaters. During this time, there were no home releases. In 1999, the film was screened at the San Sebastián Horror and Fantasy Film Festival in Spain. When the tapes were returned to Japan, they were seized and destroyed by Japanese Customs at Narita Airport; it was thereafter banned from domestic imports and screenings in Japan. Nonetheless, it was specially screened at the Tokyo International Fantastic Film Festival in 2004, where it won first place in a fan vote. Directly after, a ban was placed on the film at the request of the police, which lasted eight more years in Japan. In 2006, the French company Ciné Malta obtained the rights to release the film on DVD in its original form. This was the first time the uncensored version of Midori was accessible since screenings before 1994. The DVD also included English, Spanish, Italian, and German subtitles, as well various features—including a recorded interview with Harada and a 16-page booklet. However, the tapes initially sent to France were confiscated as ""obscene material"" at De Gaulle Airport due to cautionary notices attached to the shipments by Narita Airport. As of the 2010s, the film was screened frequently throughout Asia and Europe—especially the latter—but never in the United States, due to import laws regarding certain types of pornography. In 2013, the original 16 mm negatives of the film were discovered in a warehouse belonging to Japanese post-production company IMAGICA. The film was remastered and screened in digital format, including at the Kanazawa Film Festival that same year. Regardless, Chika Gentou Gekiga: Shoujo Tsubaki will forever be notorious for its taboo content and complex history. It is in some regards considered lost media and is also considered one of the most controversial anime due to being banned almost everywhere, including in Japan.",,,Imagica,,Mippei Eigeki Kiryuukan,"Drama, Horror",,"Gore, Historical",

Ciel, restrained by a Golem's hand, attempts to run over to the monument but falls over as it reaches for her again. Part of the monument falls away showing Zero awakening, causing the monument to explode, annihilating the Neo Arcadian forces in the process. He then levitates over the blazing inferno holding an unconscious Ciel while a voice over mentions he has been awoken and asks what he ought to do. It then cuts to gameplay snippits, including Zero's fight with Sage Harpuia, before showing Zero among blazing wreckage. The Rockman Zero 2 commercial features Zero and Panter Flauclaws, who is much larger in the commercial than in the game, fighting as Flauclaws slams Zero into a wall and pins him. As Zero struggles to free himself, Ciel stands in front of the Resistance in defiance as Flauclaws' targets them and proceeds to unveil an energy cannon from his mouth. Zero starts shifting colors before assuming his Energy form and knocks him away. He then jumps up and unveils his Chain Rod as Ciel watches. It then cuts to gameplay segments, including the actual in-game battle with Panter, before showing off the forms Zero can take in the game. In the Rockman Zero 3 commercial, Zero, in a flowery environment, is significantly damaged to such an extent that he has to lean on his Z-saber while struggling to stand as Ciel watches with noticeable concern in the background. It then shifts to a giant robot (indicated in the Telos interview with the ad creators to be Tretista Kelverian) collapsing with such force that it causes a dust cloud to envelop the area. It then shows gameplay clips, before cutting to a panting Zero looking at the camera while showing the title. The Rockman Zero 4 commercial shows a conglomeration of gameplay clips before showing a white sketch of Zero turning around in a pose mirroring his pose for the game, only to calmly close his eyes and fade away as Japanese text comes up translating to ""Everything goes to Zero.""",,,,,,"Action, Adventure",,"Mecha, Video Game",

However, due to budget constraints, it was cancelled. The pilot has not surfaced since, however material such as concept art and storyboards have been found.
